            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendship is one of the greatest blessings that not everyone is lucky enough to have. We meet a lot of people in the journey of life but there are only a few who leave a mark on us. My friends has been able to make a positive impact on my life although were only part of each other's lives for a few years, our friendship is still developing. They are always with me through all the thicks and thins. Most importantly, I feel extremely fortunate to have a great friends in my life. In this essay on my best friend, I will tell you about how we became friends and about their best qualities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friendship started when we were a senior high school student. all of us were hesitant to talk to each other at first, but gradually we developed a bond. I remember the first time my best friend tried to talk to me and I was hesitatant if I should socialize with him. However, to my surprise, we became best friends by the end of the school year.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learned so many things about each other and found out that our taste in music was similar. Since then, there was no stopping us. We spent all our time together and our friendship became known. We used to help each other out in studies and visited each other's homes as well. We also plan a meet up for whatever we will do on every sundays. On our summer break, we even went out for swimming and made a lot of memories. Also during the summer holidays, we would often hang out at one of my friend's house. Moreover, we even invented our own handshake which we only knew. Through this bond, I learned that family doesn't end with blood because my best friend was no less than my family. Friendship is one relationship that you choose, unlike all other relationships.</p>

                <h2>Qualities of My Best Friend</h2>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel one of the main reasons why I formed such a bond with my best friend was because of their qualities that they possesses. One of them would apparently teach me on how to develop a social skills which i lack off during that time. They also have this attitude or mindset that no matter what happens, just be happy and enjoy every moment of your life with your loved ones.</p>
